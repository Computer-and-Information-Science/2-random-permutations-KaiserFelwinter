# Assignment 2 Reflection - Kalonji George

## Approach to the Problem

I approched the problem of the three different functions by thinking back to similar work that ive done in prior 
classes and using that insight to decide the best coding methods for this assignment


## Techniques Used

In order to complete this assiginment I mostly used loops in order to populate my arrays and 
keep calling the randint() function, along with using do while loops in the first and second methods to force 
the code to keep runing until it found all original numbers for the array.


## Challenges Encountered

The only real challenge I encountered was remebering how to set up loops in order to have arrays get poputaled. 
In order to overcome this I took a look back at some of my previous assignments for help.

## Conclusions

From this assginment that I need to make sure im refreshing myself on things during and inbetween classes as this
assignment should not have started out the way it did for me.
